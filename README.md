## Overview

### Project Outline

- This is a expense chart that the user can move the mouse over the bars and get additional info.

#### Project requirements

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different color to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### Current/Continued Development

- What would I like to do to improve the project in the future?
  Find a way to implement the same design but with grid.
  Not sure that would be an improvement.

## My Process

### Built With

HTML, CSS, JS
Asynchronous coding

### What I Learned

- That grid is cool, but can get complicated quickly.
- Using the methods I've already learned how to use is perfectly valid.
- Talk out the problem more.
